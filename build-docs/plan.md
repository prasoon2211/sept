# Open-Source Hex-Like Analytics Platform Design

Hex is a collaborative data science and analytics platform that combines notebooks, data visualization, and dashboards in one unified workspace. Its value proposition is enabling analysts to write **SQL and Python** side-by-side, quickly visualize results, and share insights as interactive apps or dashboards. For example, Hex “combines SQL, Python, spreadsheets, and viz without jumping between tools”[\[1\]](https://hex.tech/#:~:text=Code%20and%20no,place). Users can build complex data workflows in a notebook and then “quickly build an interactive app – a dashboard, a report, or a complex tool – on top of the logic and then publish it, share it with others”[\[2\]](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/episodepage/turning-notebooks-into-collaborative-and-dynamic-data-applications-with-hex#:~:text=And%20so%20what%20we%20built,how%20to%20come%20in%20and). In the open-source version, our goal is to capture the **core 80% of this value** with minimal implementation overhead, while architecting the codebase to allow future growth.

## Key Features to Build (80/20 Focus)

- **Polyglot Notebook (SQL + Python):** The core is a notebook interface where analysts can write **SQL and Python code** together. Each SQL cell is “a fully fledged query IDE complete with autocompletion, caching, \[and\] a Data browser”[\[3\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=Hex%20has%20first,an%20extremely%20flexible%20querying%20environment). Users should be able to interleave Python and SQL cells, chain queries, and pass results between them. (In Hex this lets an analyst, for instance, run a Snowflake query, process the result in Python, then run another SQL join[\[4\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=Snowflake%20SQL%20query%2C%20and%20then,using%20a%20Dataframe%20SQL%20query).) This unified environment (as shown below) avoids switching tools.

- **Interactive Visualization Cells:** The notebook should support built-in chart/table cells. For the MVP, we can include a basic charting UI (e.g. pivot charts on query results or Python dataframes). In the future, users can set up interactive dashboards (Hex calls these “Apps”) by arranging chart cells and input controls. Initially we’ll focus on static charts; later phases can add filtering and parameter inputs.

- **Data Connections & Warehouses:** From day one, support querying modern data warehouses (Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift, etc.). Architect data connections as pluggable modules. In practice this means allowing workspace admins to add a **connection** with credentials (e.g. Snowflake account, Redshift endpoint). At runtime, SQL cells targeting that connection are executed through the appropriate driver (e.g. Python Snowflake Connector, psycopg2 for Redshift). We should also support querying local data (CSV, upload) or Pandas DataFrames for quick prototyping. This dual approach (remote-DB SQL vs local-DF SQL) is exactly how Hex’s SQL cells work[\[5\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=1,query%20can%20refer%20to%20previous)[\[6\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=4,SQL%2C%20Python%2C%20or%20other%20cells).

- **Multi-User Workspaces:** Implement an organization workspace model. Users belong to a workspace (org), have roles (Admin, Editor, Viewer), and can share projects and data connections. Admins control who can create/edit projects. This matches Hex’s model of workspace roles and project permissions[\[7\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/collaborate/sharing-and-permissions/sharing-permissions#:~:text=How%20can%20you%20share%3F)[\[8\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/collaborate/sharing-and-permissions/sharing-permissions#:~:text=There%20are%20different%20types%20of,permissions%20available%20for%20different%20resources). In Phase 1, we’ll launch with a simple model (all users see all projects or invited by email) and a PostgreSQL-backed user/accounts table.

- **Collaboration (Comments & Editing):** Allow users to comment on cells and see each other’s presence. Hex implements **cell-level locking** rather than complex real-time merges. In practice, when a user starts editing a cell they “acquire a lock” so others cannot edit it simultaneously[\[9\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=While%20this%20could%20be%20a,lock%20or%20have%20it%20taken). This avoids text conflict while still showing live presence and comments. (For MVP we can allow only one editor per cell and autosave revisions.) For example, a colleague could tag someone in a cell’s comment, as shown below, and collaborate on the query.

_Figure: Hex supports in-line comments on cells. Users see each other’s presence and can tag colleagues (e.g. “@Nikola” above). Under the hood, Hex uses per-cell locks to prevent edit conflicts[\[9\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=While%20this%20could%20be%20a,lock%20or%20have%20it%20taken)._

- **Versioning & Undo:** Basic version history of notebook projects should be supported (e.g. Git-style saves or database version rows). Hex even stores undo operations with each atomic change[\[10\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=Finally%2C%20we%20implemented%20undo%20%2F,As%20an%20example). At minimum we’ll implement periodic autosave snapshots so users can revert to earlier states of a notebook.

- **Authentication & Security:** Use a modern auth system (e.g. [Auth.js/NextAuth](https://github.com/nextauthjs/next-auth) or “better-auth”) for signup/login. Store user credentials securely in Postgres (or tied to a workspace directory). Enforce row-level security so that only authorized users access each workspace’s data (and data connections).

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend (Next.js \+ React):** We will build the UI in [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) using React. Next.js provides server-side rendering and a robust routing system for the notebook editor, project pages, and admin UI. We can use Apollo Client or React Query for data fetching. This matches Hex’s own use of React/GraphQL for UI.[\[11\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=,our%20frontend%20and%20backend%20services)

- **Backend API (Node/TypeScript \+ GraphQL):** We plan an Apollo/GraphQL API server (Node or TypeScript) to connect the frontend and database. As Hex’s engineers note, GraphQL lets us “build an API schema shared by frontend and backend” with type safety[\[11\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=,our%20frontend%20and%20backend%20services). We’ll define types for projects, cells, queries, users, etc., and implement resolvers in Node/Express. GraphQL also simplifies real-time updates (via subscriptions) when we add live collaboration later.

- **Primary Database (PostgreSQL):** Store all metadata—projects, cells, user accounts, workspace info, schedules, semantic models—in Postgres. Hex itself uses Postgres for normalized state storage. This ensures relational integrity (transactions, constraints) for collaborative edits. We can use an ORM (Prisma, TypeORM) or plain SQL.

- **Compute Engine (Python Kernels):** For code execution, we will rely on Python. Specifically, each notebook (or user session) will have an associated Python kernel or process. We can leverage Jupyter’s architecture: e.g. run a Jupyter kernel manager on the server (or spawn Docker containers) that listen for code execution requests. The frontend will send Python cell code to the server (via GraphQL/HTTP), which routes it to the kernel. The kernel’s stdout/outputs are captured and returned to the frontend. Libraries like [jupyter_server](https://github.com/jupyter-server/jupyter_server) or nbclient can manage execution. We may start simpler by calling a persistent Python process (using something like [node-jupyter](https://github.com/yujiosaka/node-jupyter) or a custom child process) to maintain state between cells. Over time, this can evolve into a full JupyterHub/Kubernetes setup.

- **SQL Execution:** SQL cells will also be executed by the backend. A SQL cell targets a specific data connection or a local dataframe. For a remote warehouse, the backend will use the appropriate driver (e.g. snowflake-connector-python, bq client, or psycopg2 for Redshift/Postgres) to run the query. For local dataframes or CSV uploads, we can use Pandas or [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) to query locally. In all cases, the backend sends the query, retrieves the results (possibly streaming large results), and sends back the row set to the frontend. To mimic Hex’s behavior, we’ll support “query mode” (return a pointer reference) vs “fetch mode” (return the whole table)[\[12\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=default%2C%20SQL%20queries%20return%20their,project%20logic%3A%20Values%20from%20other) for large data.

- **Auth & Access (NextAuth/Better-Auth):** Implement authentication via a library like NextAuth.js or next-auth, using email/password or OAuth providers. Store session state in secure cookies and user tables in Postgres. This provides a pluggable system that can integrate with the rest of the tech stack easily.

- **Optional Caching/Jobs (Redis, Message Queue):** For background tasks (e.g. scheduled runs) or caching query results, we can introduce Redis or a job queue (e.g. BullMQ). Hex uses Redis in production[\[13\]](https://himalayas.app/companies/hex/tech-stack#:~:text=PostgreSQL%20%2028), so we may use it for caching query outputs or managing running kernels. Initially, however, we can operate synchronously and scale the queue later.

## Notebook Interface Design

The notebook UI will resemble JupyterLab/Colab but with unique Hex features:

- **Cell Types:** We will support Python cells, SQL cells, and Text (Markdown) cells. Users add cells via a toolbar. A SQL cell should offer autocomplete against the connected schema and allow chaining (using Jinja or Python variables)[\[14\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=3,and%20user%20input%3A%20Queries%20will). Python cells should support plotting libraries (matplotlib, Plotly) and generate output images or tables. Text cells allow Markdown explanations.

- **Execution Model:** Cells run on-demand or when dependencies change. For simplicity, Phase 1 will run only on explicit “Run” clicks. Over time we’ll add dependency tracking: e.g. if Cell B refers to an output of Cell A, editing A can mark B stale and re-run automatically. This mimics Hex’s “reactive” cells[\[15\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=This%20lets%20you%20parameterize%20queries,SQL%2C%20Python%2C%20or%20other%20cells), but can be manual initially.

- **Chart & Table Outputs:** Build a Chart/Visualization cell type that can take a dataframe and let the user pick a chart (bar, line, scatter, pivot table, etc.). For MVP, a fixed set of charts with configurable axes is enough. We can integrate an open library like [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) or [Plotly](https://plotly.com/javascript/) for rendering. These charts should be exported as part of a project or app view.

- **Apps/Dashboards:** Hex’s “Apps” let you arrange cells into a dashboard for end-users[\[16\]](https://learn.hex.tech#:~:text=What%20are%20Apps%3F). We’ll follow the same idea: allow a notebook author to “publish” a subset of cells as a read-only app. The app view can embed charts and tables, and later allow interactive inputs (dropdowns, etc.) to filter the data. In early phases, focus on static shared dashboards (e.g. any user with “View App” permission sees the charts).

- **File & Data Uploads:** Support uploading CSV or Excel files to a project (mounted as tables or Pandas DataFrames). This requires a simple file storage (either local disk or S3) and then exposing it in SQL/Python. Hex allows uploading files and referencing them by name. We would do the same by copying uploads to a workspace bucket and registering the file path in Postgres.

## Collaboration & Real-Time Editing

Hex emphasizes team collaboration. We’ll bootstrap this carefully:

- **Workspace & Roles:** Users sign in to an organization workspace. Admins can invite others (by email). Roles (Admin/Editor/Viewer) control who can create or edit notebooks[\[17\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/collaborate/sharing-and-permissions/sharing-permissions#:~:text=You%20can%20share%20different%20resources,depending%20on%20your%20workspace%20role). Initially, all Editors share the same compute server; later, we can spawn isolated kernel processes per user.

- **Presence & Comments:** In the notebook editor, users see who else is viewing the project. We’ll display avatars on cells when someone else is editing or has selected a cell. Users can add comments to any cell (similar to Google Docs comments). These comments are stored in the database with references to the project/cell. This mimics the screenshot above.

- **Cell Locking for Edits:** Rather than implementing full Operational Transforms or CRDTs, we adopt Hex’s “Atomic Operations” approach[\[11\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=,our%20frontend%20and%20backend%20services)[\[9\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=While%20this%20could%20be%20a,lock%20or%20have%20it%20taken). Each cell edit is broken into atomic state changes. When one user begins editing a cell, we mark that cell as “locked” for others (other users see it grayed out). Only the lock-holder’s edits are sent to the server. Once saved or a short timeout expires, the lock is released. This strategy “avoids text conflicts” and was used by Hex to keep their UX simpler[\[9\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=While%20this%20could%20be%20a,lock%20or%20have%20it%20taken).

- **Version History:** Every saved edit generates a new version in Postgres. We can implement undo/redo by recording inverse operations, but more simply we’ll store snapshots (or a diff log) so users can revert to previous versions. This gives data teams confidence to explore freely.

## Data Warehouse Integration

From the start, design connectors for common warehouses:

- **Snowflake:** Use the official Snowflake Python connector. Support both username/password and key-pair authentication. Run queries via a SQLAlchemy-like engine or direct cursor, and stream results back.

- **BigQuery:** Use Google Cloud’s BigQuery client library. This may require service account credentials loaded in workspace secrets. Since BigQuery queries can be long-running, we can run them asynchronously and poll for completion.

- **Amazon Redshift:** Redshift speaks the Postgres protocol, so the psycopg2 or asyncpg driver works. Support IAM or password auth.

- **Local (DuckDB/Pandas):** For small or cross-source queries, use DuckDB (can join CSVs in-browser) or Pandas DataFrames on the Python side. Provide a UI option for “Upload CSV” that loads into Pandas or DuckDB.

Architecturally, each warehouse connector is just code that takes a SQL string and returns a result set. We’ll define a generic interface in our backend (e.g. a GraphQL mutation runQuery(connectionId, sql)). Adding a new warehouse is just adding a driver and supporting its config. Hex itself integrates popular semantic layers (dbt, Cube)[\[18\]](https://hex.tech/#:~:text=Sync%20with%20popular%20semantic%20layers), so our open version should at least allow raw queries in each warehouse.

## Phased Roadmap

We will deliver the platform in incremental phases, prioritizing core analytics value:

- **Phase 1: Core Notebook MVP (Weeks 1–8)**

- Implement user sign-up/login (Auth.js \+ Postgres). Setup workspace and project models.

- Build the notebook editor UI: add/edit/delete Python and SQL cells, Markdown text cells. Show code editor (e.g. Monaco) and an output pane.

- Wire up code execution: on “Run cell”, send SQL to the backend and display results in a table or Python execute and capture stdout. For SQL, initially support one warehouse (e.g. Postgres). For Python, run basic scripts (no long pip installs yet).

- Allow saving and loading of projects to Postgres (project \= list of cells with order). Include a simple version history (timestamped saves).

- Integrate one plotting library (e.g. Chart.js) for Python (matplotlib-\>image or Plotly) and a basic chart cell for SQL results.

- Build a “Publish App” view that shows selected outputs in a read-only dashboard.

- Minimal permissions: for MVP, allow all users to create projects and run code (single-tenant mode).

- **Phase 2: Team Collaboration & Data Apps (Weeks 8–16)**

- Add multi-user workspace: invite users by email, assign roles (Admin/Editor/Viewer). Implement sharing: an Editor can share a project with Viewers (like \[27†L109-L118\]).

- Implement cell commenting and locking. Display presence avatars on cells. Store comments in DB. Enforce one-editor-per-cell locks as per Hex’s design[\[9\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=While%20this%20could%20be%20a,lock%20or%20have%20it%20taken).

- Expand data warehouse support: add Snowflake and BigQuery connectors. Allow workspace admins to add a “Data connection” with credentials (secret values stored securely). Update the SQL cell UI to let users pick a connection.

- Polish data visualization: offer more chart types and data table formatting. Allow chart filtering (e.g. selecting points to filter downstream). Introduce input widgets (dropdowns/sliders) that Python code can reference via variables.

- Implement project version history (diff/rollback) so teams can recover.

- Basic scheduling: let users schedule a notebook run at intervals (store schedule and trigger via CRON or server). Send email notifications on success.

- **Phase 3: Compute Scaling & Advanced Features (Weeks 16+)**

- Migrate to dynamic compute: instead of one shared Python process, spawn isolated kernels (e.g. Docker or Kubernetes pods) per notebook run or per user. Implement queuing and autoscaling (on AWS, use EKS or ECS).

- Real-time collaboration (optional): if needed, add WebSocket updates so multiple editors see changes live. (With our cell-locking approach, this is mostly UI work.)

- AI/SQL generation agent (future): integrate an LLM (like HuggingFace/OpenAI) for features like “Text-to-SQL” autocomplete. Hex’s Notebook Agent uses Anthropic’s Claude to auto-generate queries[\[19\]](https://hex.tech/blog/introducing-notebook-agent/#:~:text=Start%20with%20any%20question%2C%20and,tedious%20parts%20of%20data%20work), but we can consider open-source models later.

- Semantic models and governance: plan for supporting a semantic layer (user-defined metrics) as Hex does. We can sync with tools like dbt or let admins define key queries centrally.

- Integrations: add OAuth SSO, Slack notifications (Hex integrates Slack at steps), embedding apps in other sites.

Throughout, we will keep the code modular and documented so the community can contribute. By the end of Phase 2, the open-source system will already allow teams to connect to their Snowflake/BigQuery, analyze data in shared notebooks, and publish interactive dashboards for their colleagues – achieving the core 80% of Hex’s value[\[2\]](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/episodepage/turning-notebooks-into-collaborative-and-dynamic-data-applications-with-hex#:~:text=And%20so%20what%20we%20built,how%20to%20come%20in%20and)[\[3\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=Hex%20has%20first,an%20extremely%20flexible%20querying%20environment). Later phases will harden scalability and collaboration so that the platform can serve many teams in production.

**Sources:** We based this design on Hex’s public documentation and engineering blog. For example, Hex’s engineers describe using Apollo+GraphQL, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL for their state model[\[11\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=,our%20frontend%20and%20backend%20services). Their product marketing highlights the combination of SQL and Python with built-in charts[\[1\]](https://hex.tech/#:~:text=Code%20and%20no,place)[\[3\]](https://learn.hex.tech/docs/explore-data/cells/sql-cells/sql-cells-introduction#:~:text=Hex%20has%20first,an%20extremely%20flexible%20querying%20environment) and their ability to turn notebooks into shared apps[\[2\]](https://www.pythonpodcast.com/episodepage/turning-notebooks-into-collaborative-and-dynamic-data-applications-with-hex#:~:text=And%20so%20what%20we%20built,how%20to%20come%20in%20and). We also drew from Hex’s blog on collaboration, which explains their use of atomic operations and per-cell locking to enable team editing[\[9\]](https://hex.tech/blog/a-pragmatic-approach-to-live-collaboration/#:~:text=While%20this%20could%20be%20a,lock%20or%20have%20it%20taken). These insights guided our open-source architecture so we capture the same key capabilities.
